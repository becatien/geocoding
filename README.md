# geocoding
# Create geocoordinates of rural places in africa
# Requires you to have a google API key 
# Pull data from a list of rural places in a csv file
# Read the file, and search for the name of the place on google maps
# pull the geographic coordinates and write the latitude and longitude in a new csv file
# i also added a code that convert coordinates to a 1 decimal number to match my other csv files
